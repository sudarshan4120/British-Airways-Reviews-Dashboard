# British-Airways-Reviews-Dashboard

This is a dashboard that I created to visualize airline data. The data includes information on average ratings, reviews, and other metrics for different airlines, aircraft, and routes.

This dashboard is designed to visualize airline data and explore various performance metrics, including ratings, reviews, and value for money.

# Key features
- Interactive exploration: Filter data by airline, aircraft type, route, and date range.
- Multiple metrics: View average ratings, reviews, and value for money metrics.
- Visualizations: Leverage bar charts, maps, and line graphs to understand data trends.
- Comparative analysis: Compare aircraft types and routes side-by-side.
# Data sources
This dashboard uses sample airline data that is included in Tableau Desktop.
How to use the dashboard
- Open the dashboard in Tableau Desktop.
- Use the filters on the left-hand side to select the data you want to view.
- Click on the different visualizations to explore the data in more detail.
- Use the tooltips to get more information about specific data points.

This dashboard is a work in progress and may be updated in the future.
